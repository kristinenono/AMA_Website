**Sprint Review**
a. What did you learn from doing our second sprint?
We were pretty good at delegating work last time but did better at being functional and doing it in a normal time frame.

We were able to help each other out more in this sprint. The calendar and subcollection were large improvements to our project. 

c. What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?
Some of the problems we had were with console errors and how to deal with them in the background - has been resolved

d. How can you make things better next time?
Continue to open up the work for other people and communicate with each other for help, commenting out lines of code 

e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?
yes! We feel like we only have little bugs to fix but are pretty much done!

f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?
group 8 -- everyone was present 
they were very good at communicating and talking through what they could have improved on and where they made a lot of improvements in the form of more in person meetings. They discussed how the calendar was difficult but how they troubleshooted it.
