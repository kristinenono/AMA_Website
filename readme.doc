worked with the 3 column layout, styles, and the borders. I also worked on the Add event button and the calendar form. I also worked with the code for the calendar itself but then went and deleted it.

I have been working to troubleshoot some of the margin issues and layouts on the trello, and adding in the new tasks into the trello. 
c. Any problems are you facing?
Some of the problems we are facing are bulma vs the color scheme
- solution is to have both css and bulma, primarily use bulma for forms and cal page, could become a problem further down the line when converting to one page.

b. What are you planning to do today?
Also have been working with the cards for the upcoming events and created separate branches to look at
c. Any problems are you facing?
Finding that it will be difficult to have the different colors for the varying events, will want to stick to one color. Connecting the card to the form to the calendar will be difficult. 
She is also having problems with the margins but will work to resolve that.
